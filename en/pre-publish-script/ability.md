| 1   | You can use the built-in `variable` to replace template variables in sending messages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2   | You can use the built-in `variable pipe (variable pipe)` to realize the processing of variables, such as converting to numbers, converting to strings, all variable pipes will be executed in order, and the return value of the previous processing will be used as next input value                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 3   | You can use `pipe` to process the entire message body, the pipe will be executed in order, and the return value of the previous processing will be used as the input value of the next                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4   | You can add custom `variable(variable)`. The custom variable can be `function`. At this time, the return value will be used as the processed variable, or it can be a variable such as a string or a number. It will be Return it directly as a variable. The first parameter of `function` will pass in the entire message body. For specific usage, please refer to [Pre-publish script > Usage](en/pre-publish-script/usage?id=_3) and [ Pre-publish script>Example](en/pre-publish-script/demo) |
| 5   | You can add a custom `variable pipe (variable pipe)`, which is of `function` type, and will pass in the entire message body and the parameters that need to be passed in, and use the return value as a template variable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6   | You can add a custom `pipe` to process the entire message body and return a new message body                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
