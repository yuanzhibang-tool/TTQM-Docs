> The Pre-Publish Script refers to the script that performs template replacement, variable replacement and other operations on the message to be published before publishing the message, for example: replacing `time`, `unix timestamp`, `uuid`, etc. in the message, Users can process via the built-in `variable`,`variable pipe`,`pipe`, and users can also expand custom `variable`,`variable pipe`, `Pipe` for more features, see [Pre-Publish Script](en/pre-publish-script/default.md) for details.

!>Note: The difference between `variable pipe` and `pipe` is that `variable pipe` is used to process a single template variable, while `pipe` is used to process the entire message body.
