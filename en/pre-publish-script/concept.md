> Refers to the use of scripts to perform template replacement, variable replacement, and other operations on the message to be sent before sending the message, and then send it, for example: replacing `time`, `unix timestamp`, `uuid`, etc. in the sent message, Users can process through the built-in `variable`,`variable pipe`,`pipe`, and users can also use `variable`,`variable pipe` , `Pipeline (pipe)` for expansion, see [pre-publish script](en/pre-publish-script/default.md) for details

!>Note: The difference between `variable pipe variable_pipe` and `pipe pipe` is that `variable pipe variable_pipe` is used to process a single template variable, while `pipe pipe` is used to process the entire message body
